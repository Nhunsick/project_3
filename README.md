# 2018 House of Representative Election Forecasts 

# Business Problem
How well can we predict the outcome of the 2018 House of Representatives election?

# Data Sources
- 2018 MIT Election Data and Science Lab
- Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Elections, specifically the 2018 House of Representative election 

# Results
Created a Margin of Victory scale to determine how likely each political party will win a county 

MOV = the difference of the votes between the two major political parties then divided by the total votes
